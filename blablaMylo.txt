On the edge of the galaxy
Humans bring insanity
You will fall into oblivion
I bring you chaos
Indeed
Your particles will be disintegrated
Your children will vanish
Your screams are useless
I only hear your broken bones
I only hear your broken bones
Your putrid remains will feed the colony
Your particles will be disintegrated
We need to stop the human virus
We need to break this storm
The invasion just begins, just begins
The invasion just begins, just begins
I shall transcend your species
I create your world
I can destroy it
The earth beneath your feet will shake
Now, pray your gods
I take their place
Now, pray your gods
I give you a present
The ending process
