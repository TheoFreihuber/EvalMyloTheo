# Ceremonial Vortex
We, ancient gods of this world
Are called by hunger
The sentence of your blasphemy has come
We are above your understanding
We will spread fear and terror
We will spread fear and terror
In the eyes of your children
When the planets are aligned
And in a final solar flare
Our seeds will drink your vile blood
Let the stars be my witness
We will open the cerеmonial vortex
Your flesh and bones distortеd
Will paint a grim picture
Our ships of dark matter
Powered by a gigantic black hole
Will be the temple of your submission
